Transfer Learning is used to classify images with high performance.

This script is created to train a pre-trained convolutional neural network model. (Transfer Learning.)

A CNN model has two parts; first part is convolutional layer which extract features from images and second part is neural layer which classifies the extracted features.

In Transfer Learning, we used a pre-trained CNN model as convolutional layer and add our neural layers according to our outputs.
